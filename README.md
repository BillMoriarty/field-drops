### iOS Augmented Reality app experimenting with RealityKit for sound player interaction
</br>

This little ARKit augmented reality app was made to try:
- using RealityKit to generate shapes instead of importing pre-made assets
- create a sound/music player that I can interact with with trigger sounds
- using animation subscriptions to programmatically, continually animate a RealityKit object. I didn't expect to need to do this, but I wanted the objects to continually spin during sound playback, and it seems that functionality is not built in. [The animation subscription is found here](

I wanted shadows on the desk from the 3D objects, but I think I only partially achieved this effect. There is a light grey circle placed on a desk under the 3D objects, and an occlusion mask applied to the 3D objects so they appear to cause something like a shadow.

This app is on the  App store as ["Field Drops."](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/field-drops/id1630444584)
